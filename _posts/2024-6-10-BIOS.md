**BIOS-first step**

*The main function of BIOS is to set up hardware and start an OS

*When the computer is powered on, the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) initializes the hardware,         including the screen and keyboard, and tests the main memory. This process is also called POST (Power On Self Test).

*The BIOS software is stored on a read-only memory (ROM) chip on the motherboard. After this, the remainder of the boot process is controlled by the operating system(OS)

*It also manages data flow between the computer's operating system (OS) and attached devices, such as the hard disk, video adapter, keyboard, mouse and printer.

**MBR (Master Boot Record)**

Master boot record is the information present in the first sector of any hard disk. It contains the information regarding how and where the Operating system is located in the hard disk so that it can be booted in the RAM.

MBR is sometimes called master partition table because it includes a partition table which locates every partition in the hard disk.

**LINUX FILESYSTEM**

Linux file system is generally a built-in layer of a Linux operating system used to handle the data management of the storage. It helps to arrange the file on the disk storage. It manages the file name, file size, creation date, and much more information about a file

In Linux, the file system creates a tree structure. All the files are arranged as a tree and its branches. The topmost directory called the root (/) directory. All other directories in Linux can be accessed from the root directory.

**KEY CONCEPTS OF FILESYSTEMS**

**Files and Directories**:

**Files**: A file is a collection of data that is stored on a disk. It can be anything from a text document to an executable program.
**Directories**: Directories (or folders) are special types of files that contain references to other files and directories, creating a hierarchical structure.
Mounting:

Before a filesystem can be used, it must be mounted. Mounting is the process of attaching a filesystem to a directory structure. The root directory (/) is the top of this structure, and other filesystems can be mounted at any point in this hierarchy.

**Linux File system structure**

Linux file system has a hierarchal file structure as it contains a root directory and its subdirectories. All other directories can be accessed from the root directory. A partition usually has only one file system, but it may have more than one file system.

**DIRECTORY STRUCTURE**

Directories can be organized in a tree-like hierarchy in Linux and several other operating systems.
The directory structure of Linux is well-documented and defined in the Linux FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard). 


/bin	 binary or executable programs.
/etc	system configuration files.
/home	home directory. It is the default current directory.
/opt	optional or third-party software.
- /tmp	temporary space, typically cleared on reboot.
/usr	 Installed software ,shared libraries
/var 	log files.
/boot	It contains all the boot-related information files and folders such as conf, grub, etc.

/dev	It is the location of the device files such as dev/sda1, dev/sda2, etc.

/lib	It contains kernel modules and a shared library.

**some basic commands of linux**
- pwd- presnet working directory
- ls- list (to list the files)
- ll- long listing
- touch (to create a file)
- mkdir (to create directory)
- cp (copy a file )
- mv (we can use mv command to mv file from one location to another or also we can rename the file using this)

**MANAGING LOCAL USERS AND GROUPS**

- what is user ?
- user is an entity in a linux OS, that can manipulate files and perform several operations 
- Each user has unique ID 
- Different people has diff role in the system
- There is no permissions/boundaries for the root

- There are 3 types of users in the system
- Root user (Root has no boundaries and able to do all things in a system)
- System user (services managed in the background...Apache,httpd..... managed in the background)
- Local user (some privileges to do in a boundary)

**SUDO**
- If root can give all permision to the normal user then he has no boundaries and it will become a superuser

- FOR EXAMPLE:
- if someone ask to create a user in a system then he will not be able to create because he is a normal use. IF root can give specific -
- permission then normal user become sudo user and he can create user in a system  

 **WHAT IS THE UID FOR ALL 3 USERS**
  -               ID
  - **root          0**
  - **system usrs  1 to 999**
  - **local users  1000 to .....60,000**

- #cat /etc/passwd (to see the info abt users)
- #cat /etc/group (to see the info abt groups)
- #userdd aman (to add user in a system)
- #passwd aman (to give passwd to the user) 
- #useradd -u 3445 aman (to give user specific UID)
- #groupadd -g 7890 sales (to give group specific gid )

**GROUPS** 
- There are 2 types of groups in a sytem
- **Primary group** (At the time of mking user suppose i add the user with the name A then at the same time there is a primary grp automatically created .Primary group means private grp of this user )

- **Supplementary group** (In supplementary grp we just trying to add user to work in a system and is called supplementary grp )

- #cat /etc/group (to see the info abt group)
- #groupadd sales (to create a group)
- #usermod -aG sales aman (to add user in sales group)
             or
- #groupmems -g sales -a aman 

**SUDO**
- If someone ask normal user to add some user in a system then it's completely permission denied because he is a normal user he cannot able to do that type of work 
-    Then root will give permission to the user,now he has some root privilages now he can add user that's called sudo.
Basically normal user with some root privilages called sudo

- #Vi /etc/sudoers
 - shubham ALL=(ALL) ALL

- #cat /etc/shadow (to check the passwd of user)

**PERMISSIONS**
- File permissions are an imp part of managing and maintaining a linux system because they control access to files and directories.
ACCESS MODE 777 makes a file fully readable,writable and executable for everyone

- #ll -d /salesdata  
- drwx   r-w     r-w          root  root            /salesdata
 - user   group  others        owner group
-  owner

- #chown root /salesdata (root can do anything in the dir)
- #chgrp mkt /salesdata (all the members of mkt can work in a dir)
- #chown root:mkt /salesdata (we can use this command to change the owner and grp from the one command)

- #chmod 766 /salesdata
- #chmod 755 /salesdata (it means user owner has full permission rwx , group have only r-x permission and others have also rw permission)

**we have 3 special permission** 
- -**SUID (set user ID)** 
- -**Sticky (this permission is used suppose if rahul user create a file it means only owner can delete the file not others )**

- -**SGID(set group ID) (If we create a file and we use sgid permission then its group is automatically changed)**

**DEFAULT PERMISSIONS **

- R- 4
- W- 2
- X- 2
- STICKY- 1
- SGID-  2

**UMASK**
- UMASK command in linux is used to set default permissions for files or directories the user creates.

- **UMASK (0022)**
- for directory - 777
- for files - 666
 
- 777-022=755
- 666-022=644

- **Default config file of UMASK :  vi /etc/bashrc
