**BIOS-first step**

*The main function of BIOS is to set up hardware and start an OS

*When the computer is powered on, the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) initializes the hardware,         including the screen and keyboard, and tests the main memory. This process is also called POST (Power On Self Test).

*The BIOS software is stored on a read-only memory (ROM) chip on the motherboard. After this, the remainder of the boot process is controlled by the operating system(OS)

*It also manages data flow between the computer's operating system (OS) and attached devices, such as the hard disk, video adapter, keyboard, mouse and printer.

**MBR (Master Boot Record)**

Master boot record is the information present in the first sector of any hard disk. It contains the information regarding how and where the Operating system is located in the hard disk so that it can be booted in the RAM.

MBR is sometimes called master partition table because it includes a partition table which locates every partition in the hard disk.

**LINUX FILESYSTEM**

Linux file system is generally a built-in layer of a Linux operating system used to handle the data management of the storage. It helps to arrange the file on the disk storage. It manages the file name, file size, creation date, and much more information about a file

In Linux, the file system creates a tree structure. All the files are arranged as a tree and its branches. The topmost directory called the root (/) directory. All other directories in Linux can be accessed from the root directory.

**KEY CONCEPTS OF FILESYSTEMS**

**Files and Directories**:

**Files**: A file is a collection of data that is stored on a disk. It can be anything from a text document to an executable program.
**Directories**: Directories (or folders) are special types of files that contain references to other files and directories, creating a hierarchical structure.
Mounting:

Before a filesystem can be used, it must be mounted. Mounting is the process of attaching a filesystem to a directory structure. The root directory (/) is the top of this structure, and other filesystems can be mounted at any point in this hierarchy.

**Linux File system structure**

Linux file system has a hierarchal file structure as it contains a root directory and its subdirectories. All other directories can be accessed from the root directory. A partition usually has only one file system, but it may have more than one file system.

**DIRECTORY STRUCTURE**

Directories can be organized in a tree-like hierarchy in Linux and several other operating systems.
The directory structure of Linux is well-documented and defined in the Linux FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard). 


/bin	 binary or executable programs.
/etc	system configuration files.
/home	home directory. It is the default current directory.
/opt	optional or third-party software.
/tmp	temporary space, typically cleared on reboot.
/usr	 User related programs.
/var 	log files.
/boot	It contains all the boot-related information files and folders such as conf, grub, etc.

/dev	It is the location of the device files such as dev/sda1, dev/sda2, etc.

/lib	It contains kernel modules and a shared library.
