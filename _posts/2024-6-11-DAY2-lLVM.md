**IMPROVING CLI PRODUCTIVITY**
- sequence of commands it means to say if we trying to run multiple command at a single time in the form of sequence we called a script 

**BASH SCRIPT**

- A bash script is a txt file containing a series of commands.Any command that can be executed in the termial can be put into a bash script.

- BASH SCRIPT are given an extension of .sh 

- FOR EXAMPLE
- # vi blockdev.sh
- # #!/bin/bash
-   echo "this is my first bash script " > ~/output.txt
-   exho " " >> ~/output.txt
-   echo "@@@@@" >> ~/output.txt
-   echo "Filesystem space" >>~/output.txt
-   echo "list block dev" >> ~/output.txt
-    :wq!

# **#!(shbang)**
# **/bin/bash (shell from my script is executed)**

- **CRONTAB**

- Crontab is generally used for job scheduling 
- cron daemon runs tasks in the background at specific time.

- we can use 2 tools :
 - **#cron daemon (default task scheduler)**
 - **#at (for one time task scheduling)**

 - **THERE ARE 2 types of jobs** 
 - ONE TIME JOB (IN THIS JOB WILL PERFORM ONLY ONCE)
 - RECURRING JOBS (IN THIS JOB WILL PERFORM EVERY HOUR,EVERY DAY,EVERY MONTH)


 - #atq

 - #cat /etc/crontab
 - #crontab -l
 - #crontab -r
 - #crontab -e
 - 30     12      *     *        *              mkdir test 
 - (min)  (hour)  (day) (month)  (day of week)
 

 - **NORMAL USER ALSO USE CRON**
- crontab -u -ash -l
- crontab-u -ash -e
- 02  12  *  *  * date >> /home/ash/date.txt

- */1          *    *  *  * date >> /home/ash/date.txt
-  (every min)

- (TO SEE LOGS REGARDING JOB SCHEDULING)
-   #cat /var/log/cron


- **#THERE IS ONE USER NAME RAHUL AND WE WANT THAT HE IS NOT ABLE TO USE CRONTAB**
-  #vi /etc/cron.deny
-    rahul
- #crontab -e 
-  (you are not allowed to do use this crontab)

- **TMP FILES**

- temporary files is a file created to store info temporarily

- **MANAGING BASIC STORAGE**
- we can do only 4 partition in a single hard disk

- 1-4 (reserved for primary )

- 5 (reserved for logical)

- **PRIMARY (1-4)(primary partition is used to save and boot an OS)**
- **EXTENDED (1-4)(Extended is divided into 4 logical partitions)**
- **LOGICAL (5)(logical partion are partition created in extended partition)**


- **SWAP**

- SWAP IS THE PART OF HARDDISK
- SWAP is used when amt of physical memory(RAM) in linux is full
- IF SYSTEM NEEDS MORE MEMORY RESOURCES AND THE RAM IS FULL ,INACTIVE PAGES IN MEMORY ARE MOVED TO THE   SWAP SPACE 
- **RAM+SWAP= VIRTUAL MACHINE**
- #fdisk /dev/sdb (to create the partition)

- **LVM(LOGICAL VOLUME MANAGEMENT)**

-  **Logical volumes can be created, resized, and deleted easily, providing a more manageable and adaptable storage environment compared to fixed partitions.**

- #fdisk /dev/sdb
- #pvcreate /dev/sdb5 /dev/sdb6
- #pvscan
- #vgcreate datastore /dev/sdb5 /dev/sdb6
- #vgdisplay datastore
- #lvcreate -L +800m -n database datastore
- NOW CREATE FILESYSTEM
- #mkfs.xfs /dev/datastore/database
- #blkid
- #mkdir lvdata
- #mount /dev/mapper/datastore-database lvdata
- #lsblk
- #df -h

- #HOW TO RESIZE THE SIZE OF lvm
- #LVRESIZE -L +400m /dev/datastore/database
- #xfs_growfs /lvdata
- #df -h
